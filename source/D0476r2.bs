This paper is a revision of [[P0476r1]], addressing LEWG comments from the 2017
Toronto meeting. See [[#rev]] for details.


Background {#bg}
==========

Low-level code often seeks to interpret objects of one type as another: keep the
same bits, but obtain an object of a different type. Doing so correctly is
error-prone: using `reinterpret_cast` or `union` runs afoul of type-aliasing
rules yet these are the intuitive solutions developers mistakenly turn to.

Attuned developers use `aligned_storage` with `memcpy`, avoiding alignment
pitfalls and allowing them to bit-cast non-default-constructible types.

This proposal uses appropriate concepts to prevent misuse. As the sample
implementation demonstrates we could as well use `static_assert` or template
SFINAE, but the timing of this library feature will likely coincide with
concept's standardization.

Furthermore, it is currently impossible to implement a `constexpr` bit-cast
function, as `memcpy` itself isn't `constexpr`. Marking the proposed function as
`constexpr` doesn't require or prevent `memcpy` from becoming `constexpr`, but
requires compiler support. This leaves implementations free to use their own
internal solution (e.g. LLVM has <a
href="http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#bitcast-to-instruction">a `bitcast`
opcode</a>).

We should standardize this oft-used idiom, and avoid the pitfalls once and for
all.


Proposed Wording {#word}
================

Below, substitute the `�` character with a number or name the editor finds
appropriate for the sub-section.

Synopsis {#syn}
--------

Under �.� Header `<bit>` synopsis [**�.�**]:

<xmp>
namespace std {
  // ...
  
  // �.�.� bit-casting:
  template<typename To, typename From>
  constexpr To bit_cast(const From& from) noexcept;
  
  // ...
}
</xmp>

Details {#det}
-------

Under �.�.`�` Bit-casting [**�.bitcast**]:

<xmp>
  template<typename To, typename From>
  constexpr To bit_cast(const From& from) noexcept;
</xmp>

<ol>
<li>*Remarks*:
  This function shall not participate in overload resolution unless:
  <ul>
    <li>`sizeof(To) == sizeof(From)` is `true`;</li>
    <li>`is_trivially_copyable_v<To>` is `true`; and</li>
    <li>`is_trivially_copyable_v<From>` is `true`.</li>
  </ul>
  This function shall be `constexpr` if and only if:
  <ul>
    <li>`is_union_v<To>` is `false`;</li>
    <li>`is_union_v<From>` is `false`;</li>
    <li>`is_pointer_v<To>` is `false`;</li>
    <li>`is_pointer_v<From>` is `false`;</li>
    <li>`is_member_pointer_v<To>` is `false`; and</li>
    <li>`is_member_pointer_v<From>` is `false`.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>*Returns*:
    an object of type `To` whose <em>object representation</em> is equal to the
    object representation of `From`. If multiple <em>object representations</em>
    could represent the <em>value representation</em> of `From`, then it is
    unspecified which `To` value is returned. If no <em>value
    representation</em> corresponds to `To`'s <em>object representation</em>
    then the returned value is unspecified.
</li>
</ol>

Feature testing {#test}
---------------

The `__cpp_lib_bit_cast` feature test macro should be added.

Appendix {#appendix}
========

The Standard's [**basic.types**] section explicitly blesses `memcpy`:

<blockquote>

  For any trivially copyable type `T`, if two pointers to `T` point to distinct
  `T` objects `obj1` and `obj2`, where neither `obj1` nor `obj2` is a base-class
  subobject, if the *underlying bytes* (1.7) making up `obj1` are copied into
  `obj2`, `obj2` shall subsequently hold the same value as `obj1`.

  [*Example:*
```
    T* t1p;
    T* t2p;
    // provided that t2p points to an initialized object ...
    std::memcpy(t1p, t2p, sizeof(T));
    // at this point, every subobject of trivially copyable type in *t1p contains
    // the same value as the corresponding subobject in *t2p
```
  — *end example*]

</blockquote>

Whereas section [class.union] says:

<blockquote>

  In a union, at most one of the non-static data members can be
  active at any time, that is, the value of at most one of the
  non-static data members can be stored in a union at any time.

</blockquote>


Revision History {#rev}
================

r1 ➡ r2 {#r1r2}
--------

The paper was reviewed by LEWG at the 2017 Toronto meeting and feedback was
provided. In the 2017 Albuquerque meeting LEWG provided feedback regarding usage
of concepts while discussing [[P0802r0]], and EWG reviewed the paper:

  * Use "shall not participate in overload resolution" wording instead of a
    requires clause.
  * The author was asked to explore naming. LEWG took a poll in Albuquerque and
    voted to keep `bit_cast`.
  * There was strong sentiment that this facility should be available in
    freestanding implementations. LEWG is changing its guidance regarding
    freestanding header granularity, but until guidance is actually changed it
    was decided that a currently freestanding header should be used. LEWG took a
    poll in Albuquerque, and the new `<bit>` header was chosen instead of
    `<cstddef>`.
  * Call out that `constexpr` requires compiler support.
  * Make `constexpr` conditional, similar to variant's [variant.ctor] wording,
    based on an EWG straw poll in Albuquerque.

r0 ➡ r1 {#r0r1}
--------

The paper was reviewed by LEWG at the 2016 Issaquah meeting:

* Remove the standard layout requirement—trivially copyable suffices for the `memcpy` requirement.
* We discussed removing `constexpr`, but there was no consent either way. There was some suggestion that it’ll be hard for implementers, but there's also some desire (by the same implementers) to have those features available in order to support things like `constexpr` instances of `std::variant`.
* The pointer-forbidding logic was removed. It was initially there to help developers when a better tool is available, but it's easily worked around (e.g. with a `struct` containing a pointer). Note that this doesn't prevent `constexpr` versions of `bit_cast`: the implementation is allowed to error out on `bit_cast` of pointer.
* Some discussion about concepts-usage, but it seems like mostly an LWG issue and we're reasonably sure that concepts will land before this or in a compatible vehicle.

Straw polls:

* Do we want to see [[P0476r0]] again? unanimous consent.
* `bit_cast` should allow pointer types in `To` and `From`. **SF F N A SA** 4 5 4 2 1
* `bit_cast` should be `constexpr`? **SF F N A SA** 4 3 7 2 3
